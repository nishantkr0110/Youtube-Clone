# YouTube Clone - Frontend 🎥

This is the frontend part of my YouTube Clone project.  
It’s built using **React** and styled with **Vanilla CSS** and **Material UI Icons** to make it look modern and responsive.  
The goal was to create a UI that feels close to YouTube, with features like video listing, watching videos, searching, and navigating between pages.

## 🚀 Purpose
The frontend is responsible for:
- Showing videos fetched from the backend API
- Allowing users to watch videos on a dedicated page
- Implementing search functionality
- Navigating between different pages (Home, Upload, Profile, etc.)
- Making the UI responsive for both desktop and mobile

## 🛠 Tech Stack
 
- **React** (Vite for fast development)
- **Vanilla CSS** (styling)
- **Material UI Icons** (icons)
- **Axios** (API requests)
- **React Router** (page navigation)
